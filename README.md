# Evolution

Simulating the evolution of tiny neural networks.

In this demo, 200 entities called "blobs" are placed in a 128x128 environment. Each one is wired with a randomly generated neural network. At the end of each generation, all blobs on the left half are removed, and the remaining blobs are used to repopulate the next generation. This demonstration shows that as the generations progress, blobs gain the tendency to move towards the right, since that is the best method of survival per generation. A sample blob is highlighted in red in each generation, and its neural network data is displayed on the user interface.
